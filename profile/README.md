Paidea sas and STMicroelectronics, supported by the Technical University of Riga, are proud to announce the launch of the Small components, Big ideas: Hackathon for Tomorrow’s Electronics Solutions. This hackathon is supported by the Important Project of Common European Interest on Microelectronics and Communication Technologies (IPCEI ME/CT), as part of STMicroelectronics’ initiatives to share its technology and innovations with various ecosystems and foster microelectronics-related activities.


General aims and scope.

As urban populations continue to grow, the development of smart cities has become crucial for creating sustainable, efficient, and liveable urban environments. Smart cities leverage advanced technologies, such as microelectronics and the Internet of Things (IoT), to enhance various aspects of urban life, including transportation, energy management, healthcare, and public safety.

The future workforce must be well-versed in working with microelectronics and capable of devising innovative solutions to meet the challenges faced by modern cities. As technology evolves, the ability to integrate microelectronic systems into urban infrastructure will be essential.

Small components, Big ideas provides invaluable opportunities for students and researchers to gain hands-on experience with microelectronics and smart city technologies.
